          <p>We use tools like cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to gather the data listed above.
            Some of these tools offer you the ability to opt out of data collection.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>2.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools</h3>
        <div class="paraDiv-section">
          <p>We use cookies, which are small text files stored by your browser, to collect, store, and share data about
            your activities across websites, including on Udemy. They allow us to remember things about your visits to
            Udemy, like your preferred language, and to make the site easier to use. To learn more about cookies, visit
            https://cookiepedia.co.uk/all-about-cookies. We may also use clear pixels in emails to track deliverability
            and open rates.</p>

          <p>Udemy and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third-party advertisers) use
            server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device
            or browser fingerprints, and web beacons (together, <b>“Data Collection Tools“</b>) when you access and use
            the Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically track and collect certain System Data and Usage Data
            (as detailed in Section 1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered through those Data
            Collection Tools to other data that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2.2 Why We Use Data Collection Tools</h3>
        <p>Udemy uses the following types of Data Collection Tools for the purposes described:</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
          <li><span class="textUnderline">Strictly Necessary</span>: These Data Collection Tools enable you to access
            the site, provide basic functionality (like logging in or accessing content), secure the site, protect
            against fraudulent logins, and detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of your account. These are
            required for the Services to work properly, so if you disable them, parts of the site will break or be
            unavailable.</li>
          <li><span class="textUnderline">Functional:</span> These Data Collection Tools remember data about your
            browser and your preferences, provide additional site functionality, customize content to be more relevant
            to you, and remember settings affecting the appearance and behavior of the Services (like your preferred
            language or volume level for video playback).
          </li>
          <li><span class="textUnderline">Performance:</span> These Data Collection Tools help measure and improve the
            Services by providing usage and performance data, visit counts, traffic sources, or where an application was

            data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites and
            services. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may provide these service providers with a hashed,
            anonymized version of your email address (in a non-human-readable form) and content that you share publicly

        <p>We may share your data with third parties under the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this
          Privacy Policy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="textUnderline">With Your Instructors:</span> We share data that we have about you (except
            your email address) with instructors or teaching assistants for educational content you access or request
            information about, so they can improve their content for you and other students. This data may include
            things like your country, browser language, operating system, device settings, the site that brought you to
            Udemy, and certain activities on Udemy, like enrolled courses and course review. We will not share your
            email address with instructors or teaching assistants. (Account Data; System Data; Usage Data; Approximate
            Geographic Data)</li>
          <li><span class="textUnderline">With Other Students and Instructors:</span> Depending on your settings, your
            shared content and profile data may be publicly viewable, including to other students and instructors. If
            you ask a question to an instructor or teaching assistant, your information (including your name) may also
            be publicly viewable. (Account Data; Profile Data; Shared Content)</li>
          <li><span class="textUnderline">With Service Providers, Contractors, and Agents:</span> We share your data

            prevention, data analysis, marketing and advertising services (including retargeted advertising), email and
            hosting services, and customer services and support. These service providers may access your personal data
            and are required to use it solely as we direct, to provide our requested service. (All data categories)</li>
          <li><span class="textUnderline">With Udemy Affiliates:</span> We may share your data within our corporate
            family of companies that are related by common ownership or control to enable or support us in providing the
            Services. (All data categories)</li>
          <li><span class="textUnderline">With Business Partners:</span> We have agreements with other websites and

            your data with these trusted partners. (Account Data; Learning Data; Communications and Support; System
            Data)</li>
          <li><span class="textUnderline">With Credit-Granting Organizations for Continuing Education:</span> If you

          <li><span class="textUnderline">With Analytics and Data Enrichment Services:</span> As part of our use of
            third-party analytics tools like Google Analytics and data enrichment services like ZoomInfo, we share
            certain contact information or de-identified data. De-identified data means data where we’ve removed things
            like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID. This allows these providers to provide
            analytics services or match your data with publicly-available database information (including contact and
            social information from other sources). We do this to communicate with you in a more effective and
            customized manner. (Account Data; System Data; Usage Data; Cookie Data)</li>
          <li><span class="textUnderline">To Power Social Media Features:</span> The social media features in the
            Services (like the Facebook Like button) may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things

            feature. Your interactions with these features are governed by the third-party company’s privacy policy.

            necessary to administer, market, or sponsor promotions and surveys you choose to participate in, as required
            by applicable law (like to provide a winners list or make required filings), or in accordance with the rules
            of the promotion or survey. (Account Data; Sweepstakes, Promotions, and Surveys)</li>
          <li><span class="textUnderline">For Advertising:</span> If we decide to use an advertising-supported revenue
            model in the future, we may use and share certain System Data and Usage Data with third-party advertisers
            and networks to show general demographic and preference information among our users. We may also allow
            advertisers to collect System Data through Data Collection Tools (as detailed in Section 2.1), to use this
            data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your user experience (through behavioral advertising)
            and to undertake web analytics. Advertisers may also share with us the data they collect about you. To learn
            more or opt out from participating ad networks’ behavioral advertising, see Section 6.1 (Your Choices About
            the Use of Your Data) below. Note that if you opt out, you’ll continue to be served generic ads. (System

              <li>Reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other legal agreements;</li>
              <li>Required to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, misuse, potential violations of law (or rule or
                regulation), or security or technical issues;</li>
              <li>Reasonably necessary in our discretion to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or
                safety of Udemy, our users, employees, members of the public, or our Services;</li>
              <li>We may also disclose data about you to our auditors and legal advisors in order to assess our
                disclosure obligations and rights under this Privacy Policy; or</li>
              <li>Required or permitted by law.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li><span class="textUnderline">During a Change in Control:</span> If Udemy undergoes a business transaction
            like a merger, acquisition, corporate divestiture, or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of all
            or some of its assets, we may share, disclose, or transfer all of your data to the successor organization
            during such transition or in contemplation of a transition (including during due diligence). (All data
            categories)</li>

          communications between you and Udemy, the Services, or any information provided to us in connection with the

          required age for consent to use online services where they live (for example, 13 in the US or 16 in Ireland),
          may not set up an account, but may have a parent or guardian open an account and help them access appropriate
          content. Individuals younger than the required age for consent to use online services may not use the
          Services. If we learn that we’ve collected personal data from a child under those ages, we will take
          reasonable steps to delete it.

              will treat you like all other users. In other words, there is no penalty for exercising your rights under
              CCPA.</li>
            <li><b>“Right to Opt-Out” </b>- You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>CCPA has a specific definition of a “sale” and while Udemy does not, in the traditional sense, sell your
            personal information or the personal information of any of our users, we do use cookies that make
            non-personally identifiable information available to select third-parties. To opt out of such a “sale,”
            click on the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link at the bottom of this page.</p>

          <p>To exercise any of these rights under CCPA, please email <a href="#">privacy@udemy.com</a>.com or write to
            us at Udemy, Attn: Privacy/Legal Team, 600 Harrison Street, 3rd floor, San Francisco CA 94107. CCPA allows
            you to designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. For your protection, we may
            require that the request be sent through the email address associated with your account, and we may need to
            verify you and/or your agent’s identity before fulfilling your request.</p>

          <p>Additionally, for more information about the personal information we collect and how we collect it, please
            see the sections above entitled “What Data We Get” and “How We Get Data About You.”</p>

          <p>To learn about the business and commercial purposes for which your personal information is collected and
            the categories of service providers who have access to your personal information, please see the sections
            above entitled “What We Use Your Data For” and “Who We Share Your Data With.”</p>

          <p>As a California resident, you also have the right to request certain details about what personal
            information we share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To submit your
            request, send an email to <a href="#">privacy@udemy.com</a> with the phrase “California Shine the Light” and
            include your mailing address, state of residence, and email address.</p>

          <p>Since there is no widely accepted standard for the browser-initiated Do Not Track signal, we do not
            currently recognize or respond to Do Not Track signals.</p>
